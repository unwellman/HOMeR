# Notice

The original approach to this problem used Discord.py and UNIX shell scripts to
try to recover server log data from the output of screenlog.0. This was a bad idea.
Heaven forbid I'd have to learn new tools to make this project work! For a proper
approach using Bukkit's API and running the bot as a Spigot plugin, see
[unwellman/haruhi-bot](https://github.com/unwellman/haruhi-bot).

# HOMeR
Discord bot to update minecraft server status

Mostly using boilerplate code to understand how Discord handles basic data

Eventually hope to integrate existing shell scripts to allow server start/stop
and even remote command execution via Discord
